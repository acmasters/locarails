== 1.2.0

- Security compliance fix for Git repository. 
  In a shared-hosting environment it's a good thing to have SSH access from the
  outside to your remote shared server. But's usually not a good idea for, once
  inside the machine, to be able to ssh another neighbor server. So it's a good
  practice to lock down ssh connections from within the same vicinity.
  Problem is that git, by default, makes an ssh connection to itself when
  deploying. We can avoid it by giving git a local URL in the format "file://"
  that way it will use the filesystem only and will not try to open an ssh
  connection to itself.
  This version provides a monkey patch to filter capistrano's git library.
